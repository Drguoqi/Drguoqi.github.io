I graduated with a PhD from the University of Science and Technology of China, College of Astronomy and Space Science. I am currently working at Nanjing Tech University, College of Computer and Information Engineering (College of Artificial Intelligence), engaged in teaching and research.

My primary research focus is on big data and complex systems, encompassing astronomical big data, transport big data, astronomical information technology, Deep Learning, and Reinforcement Learning.

I have led the National Natural Science Foundation  (NSFC) for Young Scholars of China and the Jiangsu Province Outstanding Postdoctoral Programme, while also participating in NSFC General Projects and NSFC Key Projects.

Students with an interest in astronomy, transport, or artificial intelligence are warmly invited to contact me for collaboration and exchange!
